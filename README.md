Learning how to build Chrome Extensions
* [Official Google tutorial](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/get-started/tutorial/hello-world)

## Notes
* Create [manifest](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/manifest).json and main html page.
    * Directory is flexible but manifest.json must always be in root.
* Run scripts on every page --> declare matches (sites that you want the script to run)
